# NextPermutationOnSubsegment
Implemented a data structure that allows:
1) find the sum on the subsegment [l,r]
2) insert element x at position pos
3) remove the element x located at position i
4) to assign the element x on the subsegment [l, r]
5) add the number x on the subsegment [l, r]
6) next_permutation on the subsegment [l, r]
7) prev_permutation on the [l, r] subsegment.

All operations work for O(logn) 
This structure works on **Splay-tree** with
